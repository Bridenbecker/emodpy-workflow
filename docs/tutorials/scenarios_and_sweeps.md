# Learn how to create scenarios and do sweeps

- Use extend_frame to create hiv_vaccine frame
- Add distribution of vaccine on STIDebut to vaccine/campaign.py 
- What about doing it on their 15th birthday instead?  Simulate an annual checkup
- Run hiv_vaccine scenario and compare to baseline
- Make vaccine efficacy a hyperparameter so we can sweep it
- Create sweep file that sweeps vaccine efficacy at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0
- Run sweep and compare
