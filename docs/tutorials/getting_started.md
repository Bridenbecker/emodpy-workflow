# Getting Started with EMOD-HIV and emodpy-workflow

0) Comparison with older HIV dtk-tools workflow

If you have already been using EMOD-HIV via DtkTools, this overview will explain
what is the same and what is different.

1) Create a virtual environment and activate it.

2) [Pip install emodpy-workflow](../installation.md)

3) [Learn about the project related commands](project_related_commands.md)

This tutorial will introduce you to the set of commands that you can do with emodpy-workflow.
The other tutorials will do more with these commands and show you more on when and why to use them.

4) [Learn how to run EMOD](running_emod.md)

This tutorial will get you running your first EMOD simulations.  It shows how easy it is to
change parameters, make changes to the campaign, and plot data.

5) [Get a brief introduction to Calibration](calibration_intro.md)

In this tutorial, you will do your first simple calibration with emodpy-workflow.
You will learn how to specify reference data and the parameters to calibrate.  However, it is
not intended to teach the art/science of calibration.

6) [Learn how to create scenarios and do sweeps](scenarios_and_sweeps.md)

7) [Learn how to change the Cascade of Care](changing_the_cascade_of_care.md)
